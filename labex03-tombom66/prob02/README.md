# Credit Card Approval
Create a program that, based on user input will approve, or deny their ability
to get a credit card, and recommend them a credit card.
The Credit Card approval scores are distributed as such
```
0   ->  579 - DENIED CREDIT CARD
580 ->  669 - APPROVED FOR SILVER TUFFY CARD
670 ->  799 - APPROVED FOR GOLD TUFFY CARD
800 ->  850 - APPROVED FOR PLATINUM CARD
Less than 0 - INVALID INPUT
GREATER THAN 850 INVALID INPUT
```

Here is a sample run of what the program should look like.
```
Thank you for applying for the Tuffy Credit card. Please enter your credit score
Credit Score: 600
We can approve you for the SILVER Tuffy Card
Thank you for using our program, please come again
```

# Credit Scores and Credit Cards
Since there are a variety of inputs the user could submit, your menu prompt should display the right
message that corresponds to the user's choice.

If the user was DENIED the Tuffy Card then the output should be:
```
  Sorry, we cannot approve you for any credit card at the moment
```
If the user was APPROVED for the SILVER Tuffy Card then the output should be:
```
  We can approve you for the SILVER Tuffy Card
```
If the user was APPROVED for the GOLD Tuffy Card then the output should be:
```
  We can approve you for the GOLD Tuffy Card
```
If the user was APPROVED for the PLATINUM Tuffy Card then the output should be:
```
  We would love to approve you for the PLATINUM Tuffy Card
```
If the user input INVALID data then the output should be:
```
  You have entered in an invalid credit score. Please restart the program and try again
```

# Code evaluation
Open the terminal and navigate to the folder that contains this exercise. Assuming you have pulled the code inside of `/home/student/labex02-tuffy` and you are currently in `/home/student` you can issue the following commands

```
cd labex02-tuffy
```

You also need to navigate into the problem you want to answer. To access the files needed to answer problem 1, for example, you need to issue the following command.

```
cd prob01
```

When you want to answer another problem, you need to go back up to the parent folder and navigate into the next problem. Assuming you are currently in `prob01`, you can issue the following commands to go to the parent folder then go into another problem you want to answer; `prob02` for example.

```
cd ..
cd prob02
```

Use the `clang++` command to compile your code and the `./` command to run it. The sample code below shows how you would compile code save in `main.cpp` and into the executable file `main`. Make sure you use the correct filenames required in this problem.  Take note that if you make any changes to your code, you will need to compile it first before you see changes when running it.

```
clang++ -std=c++17 main.cpp-o main
./main
```

You can run one, two, or all the commands below to `test` your code, `stylecheck` your code's design, or `formatcheck` your work. Kindly make sure that you have compiled and executed your code before issuing any of the commands below to avoid errors.

```
make test
make stylecheck
make formatcheck
```

A faster way of running all these tests uses the `all` parameter.

```
make all
```

# Submission
1. When everything runs correctly,  let's copy your code into the Github repository. The first step is to add your code to what is called the staging area using git's `add` command. The parameter after `add` is the name of the file you want to add. There are cases when you have multiple changed files, so you can just type . (period) to add all modified files.

    ```
    git add .
    ```
1. Once everything is in the staging area, we use the `commit` command to tell git that we have added everything we need into the staging area.

    ```
    git commit
    ```
1. In case it asks you  to configure global variables for an email and name, just copy the commands it provides then replace the dummy text with your email and Github username.

    ```
    git config --global user.email "tuffy@csu.fullerton.edu"
    git config --global user.name "Tuffy Titan"
    ```
    When you're done, make sure you type `git commit` again.    
1. Git will ask you to describe what you have added to the staging area. By default, you will use a command-line based editor called *nano*. Go ahead and provide a description then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> to exit. Press <kbd>Y</kbd> to confirm that you want to make changes and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
1. Lets push all changes to the Github repository using git's `push` command. Provide your Github username and password when you are asked.

    ```
    git push
    ```
1. When you finish the exercise, go back to Titanium and click on the `Add submission` button in the lab exercise page. Provide a short message in the text area such as "finished lab exercise" and click on `Save changes`. Finally click on `Submit assignment` to inform your instructor that you are done.
