# Lab exercise 12 objectives
1. Write C++ programs
2. Compile C++ programs
3. Implement programs that use pointers and objects

# Additional Reading
This lab exercise requires an understanding of some concepts to solve the problems. You are strongly encouraged to read the following tutorials to help you answer the problems.

1. [Organizing C++ files: function prototypes, implementations, and drivers](https://github.com/ILXL-guides/function-file-organization).
1. [Using objects as parameters and return values in functions](https://github.com/ILXL-guides/object-parameters-and-return-values)
1. [Passing arrays as parameters to functions](https://github.com/ILXL-guides/arrays-as-parameters)

# Instructions
Answer the programming problems sequentially (i.e., answer prob01 before prob02). If you have questions let your instructor or the lab assistant know. You can also consult your classmates.

When you answer three programming problems correctly, let your instructor know and wait for further instruction.
